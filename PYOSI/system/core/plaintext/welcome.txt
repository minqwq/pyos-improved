The Improved version added too much programs and it's maybe better than MPGA.
Type "help" to show them.

We also support external program, type "shizuku" to run:

 - None:        Show help
 - "run":       Run a program
 - "install":   Install program from path to file
 - "remove":    Remove(delete) a program from your computer
 - "search":    Search package from Scarlet Network(スカーレット・ネットワーク)
 - Else:        start program name

Don't forget to update! run "pyosiupgrade" to update.

And we hope you try the original PY OS
It's rebirth on Jul 15 2024
