# Development a PY OS Application
Development a application is like written terminal python program  
its very easy
# Begin
Example program:  
<code>print("owo Kawaii world!")</code>  
  
Copy this program to a new py file and save
and then create a new folder on <$PY OS Improved$>/apps/<$YOUR FOLDER$>  
  
and edit pyosimproved.py  
# Add command
You can add a command at anywhere after uwufetch command, a app startup command like this:  
<code>elif cmd == "test":(Next line)  
(4 space)i = os.system("python3 ./apps/<$YOUR FOLDER$>/<$FILENAME$>")</code>  
  
And save your changes  
now we can startup PY OS Improved using <code>python3 pyosimproved.py</code> command  
After login, type your command, if not wrong the application will start and print <code>owo Kawaii world!</code> and exit to shell
