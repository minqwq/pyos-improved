It's best for UXTerm/XTerm, tty, and most common terminal emulator.
in Windows, cmd(not powershell) and ConEmu.
in Android, Termux/ZeroTermux is the best choice.
I dont know how to run it fine in MacOS X, so find it by yourself, if you have trick please send to me or pull request with this file, i will add it

After install, you need to modify the config to start PY OS Improved.
Config file location:config/config.json

And find "isWindows" line
After finded this, change "" in this line to "true" or "false"
Enjoy...
